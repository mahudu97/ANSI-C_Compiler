Overview
========

- [*Test suite*](c_test_suite.md): Each submission must contain a set of test programs which 
  are able to determine whether a given compiler implements certain C language
  features correctly.

- [*C-translator*](c_translator.md) : Your compiler will be able to translate a sub-set of C
  into equivalent Python. This allows each submission to demonstrate lexing and
  parsing functionality, even if the code generation is weak.

- [*C-compiler*](c_compiler.md) : This is a compiler from C to MIPS assembly.
  
In all cases, the source language is pre-processed C90. The target environment
is Ubuntu 16.04.
